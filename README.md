# Overview

Creating a shopping cart.

## Instructions

1. Create a single state to store all new items in the `<Index />` page and call it Cart.
2. `<Form />` component should add more shopping items to the shopping cart that exists inside the App component.
3. Create a component called `<ShoppingItem />` that's going to contain the shopping items. It can be just a normal `<p>` tag, but feel free to design it as you please :D
4. Pass the shopping carts state as a prop to `<Shopping Cart/>` which should map out all the results from the shoping cart using the `<ShoppingItem />`.

BONUS: Can you add a way in the `<ShoppingItem />` to delete the selected item from the list?
